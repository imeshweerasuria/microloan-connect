## Git Workflow (Evaluation 1)

Main branches:
- `main` (release)
- `dev` (integration)

Each member must work on their own branch:
- feature/transactions-ledger (Adheesha)
- feature/borrower-profiles (Sachini)
- feature/loans (Vitharka)
- feature/repayments (Avindya)

Rules:
1. Create branch from `dev`
2. Commit often with meaningful messages
3. Push branch and open PR to `dev`
4. No direct commits to `dev` except merge by leader
